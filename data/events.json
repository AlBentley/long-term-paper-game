        "description": "IBM has continued to aggressively restructure its worldwide business operations to improve its competitive position within a rapidly changing market for information technology products and services. Industry demand has slowed in recent years, and the industry continues to suffer from excess capacity and sluggish economic growth, particularly in Europe and Japan. The company's recent business results reflect these realities, as well as an ongoing revenue shift to offerings with lower gross profit margins, such as services and personal computers. During 1993, a number of actions were announced to \"right-size\" the company. These actions, including reductions in the company's worldwide work force, office space, capacity and related expenses, are intended to bring the company's cost and expense structure in line with industry levels. They were based on the company's assumptions of future industry demand and revenue growth. If these assumptions prove correct, the company believes it will be  able to absorb, without resorting to additional special charges, the costs  associated with any future productivity improvements. If the company's current  view of future industry revenue and demand proves incorrect, the company will  have to take further actions. The company's management strategy also shifted in  1993 from the establishment of increasingly autonomous business units--an  emerging federation of companies--to remaining an integrated provider of  information technology",
